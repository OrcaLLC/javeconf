## Timeline

TODO

## Talks

It's important to note that we're focusing this conference on _lightning talks_ and _project pods_.

### Lightning Talks

We encourage _lightning talks_ here, implying a 15-20 minute runtime, to keep ourselves and the conference focused on real projects and topics throughout. Here's the initial list of talks we're planning on:

TODO

### Project Pods

This conference is to encourage personal projects as project pods:

1. Take people,
2. Put them in a team,
3. Produce!

Consider this the _hackathon_ side of things. Each pod produces a Proof of Concept of a project, presents it (if wanted), and JaveConf shows it off.

## Location

A secluded cabin in Mammoth, CA will provide us with all the needed commodities, including but not limited to:

- a jazzy bubble bath accommodating multiple peoples
- several bedrooms for attendees
- proper parking for vehicular transports

## Organizers & Speakers
